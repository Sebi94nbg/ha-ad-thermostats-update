# Thermostats Update

This app updates Z-Wave thermostats entities (e.g. Danfoss 014G0013) state and current temperature from external sensors in the [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/).

This is [AppDaemon](appdaemon.readthedocs.io/) app.

You can install this app via [HACS](https://custom-components.github.io/hacs/) or just download `thermostats_update.py` file and save it in `/config/apps` folder.

Go to [HA community](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/update-current-temperature-for-z-wave-thermostats/32834) for support and help.
